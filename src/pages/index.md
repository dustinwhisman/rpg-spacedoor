# Spacedoor!

You work for a secret military organization that controls a device of mysterious
origins that can create wormholes to other devices throughout the galaxy.

You and your team are explorers, and it is your mission to represent Earth as
you make allies and enemies, survive alien threats, and do some light
colonialism.

## How to Play

This is a tabletop role-playing game that is meant to be played by 4 to 6
people, where one of them is the Game Manager (GM) who describes settings, sets
up scenarios, and plays Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and the other players play
their own characters, or Player Characters (PCs).

In general, the GM will present the PCs with challenges to overcome, such as
mysteries or puzzles, social conflicts, or combat, and the PCs will take
actions, in character, to respond to those challenges. Whenever the success of
an action is in question, the dice decide. The GM will ask for a roll, and the
PC will roll dice based on their stats to determine the outcome.

You'll need at least one set of polyhedral dice (or a digital dice roller), and
it will help to have pencils and paper for note-taking and managing character
sheets. If you have tokens or poker chips or anything like that, those will be
useful for tracking purposes, but they aren't strictly necessary.

started with building your character.
