# Stats and Skills

Here are the core stats and their associated skills. Sometimes you will be asked
to roll dice for a stat, but sometimes you will roll for a specific skill
instead. In that case, you'll roll the dice for the stat associated to that
skill, then add any extra dice or bonuses that you have for that skill.

Stats and skills can be [upgraded](/upgrades) in a variety of ways, including:

- Increasing the size of the die used (d4 to d6)
- Adding a bonus die (so you might roll a d8 and a d4)
- Adding a permanent bonus to rolls (+1 to the die roll)
