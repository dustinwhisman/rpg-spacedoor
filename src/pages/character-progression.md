# Character Progression

Instead of leveling up like in other game systems, this game uses a sort of
currency system for upgrading your character's stats and abilities over time. As
you play the game, you will earn Experience Points (XP) that you can spend on
upgrades and abilities.

## Earning XP

It is up to your GM to determine how and when to award XP. Here are some
suggestions for how to handle that.

- Reward individual players with XP when they make bold choices or solve your
  puzzles
- Reward all players for winning in combat or finishing a mission
- Provide in-game mechanisms for gaining XP, such as training montages or
  completing specific objectives
- Some combination of the above

## Spending XP

There are no races or classes with specific skill trees in this game. Any
character can learn any ability or increase any stat, but they must first meet
the prerequisites.

Each upgrade has a cost and prerequisites that must be met before it can be
purchased. Those prerequisites can include minimum stat levels or previous
upgrades in the tree having been purchased.

As an example, you can upgrade the dice that you use for various stats, but it
takes more XP to go from a d12 to a d20 than it does to go from a d4 to a d6.

- d4 to d6: 1XP
- d6 to d8: 2XP
- d8 to d10: 3XP
- d10 to d12: 4XP
- d12 to d20: 5XP

You can see the full [list of upgrades](/upgrades) if you want to plan ahead,
but it's probably easier to see the ones you can afford on your character sheet.
