# Action Points

This game uses Action Points (AP) as a meta resource that you use to improve
rolls or use special abilities. You start each session with your character's
maximum AP, which starts at 3, although you can buy upgrades to increase that
max.

During the game, you can spend AP to add to your own rolls or your allies'
rolls. This is most useful for close situations, where you are one or two points
away from success.

You can also spend AP to use special abilities. The descriptions of certain
[upgrades](/upgrades) will specify whether they require AP to use. You can also
increase your Max AP by buying upgrades, giving you more chances to improve
rolls or use your special abilities.

During gameplay, when you fail a roll, you earn 1 AP (unless you already had max
AP). Your GM may also reward you with AP based on your actions, like winning a
fight or negotiating your way out of danger.
